- Separation of concerns: I think the way you structure your project is excellent. Each module has a 
single clear responsibility and it is clear to me where I have to look to find an implementation.
- External request assignment algorithm: I am unsure why you use an external request assignment 
algorithm. I am sure you have a strong reason for it but since this is quite an unexpected decision,
which comes with its drawbacks I am curious why you chose to go with this. It would be nice to see 
the source code for it alongside an explanation as to why you made this decision.
- Language consistency: I'm pretty sure this is something you would have fixed later on anyway but 
if not: It would be nice if you used either English or Norwegian in your comments and even more 
importantly your logs/print statements.
- Overview documentation: As somebody new to your codebase (and hasn't been a part of your lab 
discussions) I would have liked a short high-level overview of your overall fault tolerance strategy, 
the individual modules you use and how they interact. A few lines in a README would have helped me 
build a mental model of your project before diving into the code.
- Comments: I like your commenting style. It does a good job of explaining details about code. In 
some cases, it seems a bit redundant tho. Examples would be "oppretter global instans av 
ElevatorManager" or "starter som inaktiv". In these lines, your code is quite self-documenting and 
in my opinion, you can assume other programmers understand what's going on there. I think also try to
be more consistent, some functions have detailed comments while others have none.
- Hard coded values: In some cases, you are still hardcoding values. An example is `[4][3]bool{}` 
where you could use `datatypes.N_FLOORS` to make it easier to change things in the future.
- Duplicate `ClearAllRequests` implementation: You're implementing this function both in 
`request_utilities` and `elevator_utilities`.
- Variable naming: You do a great job naming variables. I understood their purpose in most cases, 
only the HRA acronym wasn't quite clear to me at first.
